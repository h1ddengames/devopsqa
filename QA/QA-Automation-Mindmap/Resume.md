#### Typical Day on the Job
- Typical day on the job includes the following:

    #
    #### Script Design
    - Combining tests where possible in order to avoid webdriver start up time:
        - Example: Combining login and cart functionality checking.
            - Assert/Verify statements will let us know what part of the test failed so it's ok to combine these two.

    #
    #### Framework Design
    - Utilizing an Object-Oriented design to make webdriver reuse possible for parallel testing.
    - Abstracting away the need for Selenium knowlege
        - Creating self explanitory methods/ method names with simple method signatures. 
    - Combining POM (Page Object Model) + BDD(T) (Behaviour Driven Development/Testing with Cucumber) and/or KDD(T) (Keyword Driven Development/Testing with Robot Framework) and/or DDT (Data Driven Testing with Apache POI/JXL, Excel, MySQL)
