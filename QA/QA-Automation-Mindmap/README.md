# A note on this folder and testing

## A note on this folder

The markdown files contained within this directory contain the information that has either been asked in interviews or shown up in my work based on my experience alone.

The information provided is meant as a general overview rather than a deep dive into the topics. Any markdown files with "IN-DEPTH" in the title will obviously contain more information than the other files. The idea is for you to understand what might be expected of you and study according to your experience and knowledge.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the topics please PRACTICE THEM. It is one thing to read over the notes before an interview but taking some time to practice the concepts covered within these files will help you understand and answer technical questions far better than you would have if you only read the files.

## A note on the testing folder

The testing folder contains a README to help you setup a database server, api server and jenkins server. This way you can practice your sql/api/automation skills from the comfort of your own home or wherever you are practicing.

The testing folder is to be used in conjunction with a Intellj or Eclipse maven project. The project should be similar to the type of project you would find in your workplace (ie a automation testing framework using selenium, rest-assured, jdbc, jenkins, whatever other tools your workplace uses)

I recommend you put/create the project within the db-api-jenkins/jenkins/home folder that way your jenkins server will have access to it through your host machine's folder. This will make it easier to keep the server generator and your practice files together.
