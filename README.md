## Opening Notes

Everything related to DevOps will be in the DevOps/Hosting-Skills folder.

Everything related to quality assurance will be in the QA/QA-Automation-Mindmap folder.

- This repository contains all the knowledge I've gained from working in QA and going to college to learn DevOps skills.

- I made this repository in the hopes that it will help others rid themselves of impostor syndrome.
- The idea that I had while making this was that if someone were to be shown a visual of all the things they needed to know, they would be less fearful of not belonging or feeling inferior to their peers.
- The visualization is in the form of a mind map that links similar concepts together with a core concept in the middle.

## QA Automation

The QA/QA-Automation-Mindmap folder contains all the documentation on the following:

- Core-Java - The minimum required Java that will be required for job interviews and doing QA work.
- Automation-Frameworks - Several types of automation frameworks, how to set them up, and how to use them.
- Project-Management - How to plan and manage a project.
- Testing-Types - The many different testing types in QA.
- Resume - The types of things that you should know when working in QA.

#
## DevOps

The DevOps/Hosting-Skills folder contains all the documentation on the following:

- Self-Hosting - Hosting programs on a VM or local machine.
- AWS-Hosting - Hosting programs on AWS (usually on an EC2 instance)
- Vagrantfiles - Vagrant is used heavily in the DevOps section of this repository in order to quickly create a working VM.
  - I have to use Windows as my host because of programs that I cannot replace with Linux alternatives. Since I don't have Windows 10 Pro, I can't just use Docker locally so I have to create a VM then use Docker inside these VMs.
