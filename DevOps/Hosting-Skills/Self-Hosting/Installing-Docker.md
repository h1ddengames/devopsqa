## Installing Docker and Docker Compose
#

This guide uses Ubuntu 18.04

Note: I have included a script to complete all the tasks below. Please change any usernames and passwords yourself. I have marked the lines that need usernames and passwords changed for security with "# Please change this/these values: "

Note: I am using Vagrant to create a VM so my user is vagrant and my home is located in /home/vagrant. If yours is different, make sure you update the script below to your environment.

Note: You should have the Vagrantfile, setup-docker-compose.s h, and docker-compose.yaml in the same folder.

```Vagrantfile:```
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 80
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3306, host: 3306
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
  config.vm.network "public_network"
  
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.name = "Ubuntu Master"
    vb.gui = false
    vb.cpus = 4
    vb.memory = 2048
  end

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    # Copy the setup bash script.
    sudo cp /vagrant/setup-docker-compose.sh /home/vagrant/
    # Make the bash script executable.
    sudo chmod +x /home/vagrant/setup-docker-compose.sh
    # Create a directory for the docker-compose.yaml file and move the file to that folder.
    sudo mkdir /home/vagrant/docker
    sudo cp /vagrant/docker-compose.yaml /home/vagrant/docker
    # Run the bash script
    sudo bash /home/vagrant/setup-docker-compose.sh
  SHELL
end
```

```setup-docker-compose.sh:```
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

echo -e '\e[41;37m'"\033[1m ip addr: \033[0m"
ip addr | grep "inet "
```

```docker-compose.yml```
```

#
### Accessing the LAMP Stack
1. To access apache2 server go to http://localhost
2. To access phpmyadmin server go to http://localhost:8080
3. To access mysql use steps 5-6 from the Setting up the containers section.


#
### Setting up the containers (externally)
1. Start the vagrant vm:
    ```
    vagrant up
    ```
2. On your host machine run:
    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```
3. Once logged in, go into the following directory:
    ```
    cd /home/vagrant/docker
    ```
4. Run the docker-compose command to start the docker containers:
    ```
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```
5. Run the docker command to display all containers:
    ```
    sudo docker ps
    ```
6. Run the docker command to run /bin/bash terminal inside the container:
    ```
    sudo docker exec -it docker_db_1 /bin/bash
    ```
7. Logging into mysql
    ```
    mysql -u root -p
    ```
8. Enter the password that was given in the docker-compose.yaml file then run whatever mysql commands you want.

#
### Destroying the containers (teardown)
1. On your host machine run:
    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```
2. Once ssh'd into your vagrant machine run the following to delete all containers and persistent volumes:
    ```
    docker-compose down --volumes
    ```
    OR if you would like to save the volumes
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

#
### Installing Docker
1. Update the repository listing and installed programs
    ```
    sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    ```
2. Install the required programs first:
   ```
    sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
   ```
3. Add the Docker key and repository:
    ```
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```
4. Update the repository list:
    ```
    sudo apt-get -y update
    sudo apt-get -y upgrade
    ```
5. Install Docker with the following command:
    ```
    sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```
6. Check that docker has been installed:
    ```
    docker-compose --version
    ```

#
### Installing Docker Compose
1. Install Docker Compose with the following command:
    ```
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
2. Allow the program to be run by setting up the proper permission
    ```
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
3. Check that docker-compose has been installed:
    ```
    docker-compose --version
    ```
4. Install Docker-Compose autocomplete for bash
    ```
    sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.24.0/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
    ```

#
### Allowing MySQL to be accessed through JDBC driver
0. First make sure you have these lines in the docker-compose.yaml file under db:
    ```
    ports:
      - '3306:3306'
    ```
    If the above doesn't allow you to remotely access the mysql server using Java then do the steps below.
1. Log into the docker container running mysql:
    ```
    sudo docker exec -it [containernameorID] /bin/bash
    ```
2. Open /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf for editing:
    ```
    apt-get update
    apt-get install nano
    nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
    ```
3. Uncomment bind-address = 0.0.0.0
4. Restart the mysql service
    ```
    service mysql restart
    ```
5. If the steps above have not worked then log into the container again and run the following commands:
    ```
    mysql -u root -p

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'database-tester'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
6. Restart the service
#
### Using Docker Compose
1. Create a directory to hold the docker-compose.yaml file.
    ```
    mkdir ~/docker
    ```
2. Create a docker-compose.yml
    Note: there are 2 spaces where there are indents (NOT TABS or 4 spaces)
    ```
    version: '3'

    services:
      # apache2
      www:
        image: httpd:2.4
        ports: 
          - "80:80"
        volumes:
          - ./www:/var/www/html/
        links:
          - db
        networks:
          - dbphp
      # mysql database
      db:
        image: mysql:5.7
        volumes:
          - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
        restart: always
        ports:
          - '3306:3306'
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
          MYSQL_DATABASE: database
          MYSQL_USER: database-tester
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
        networks:
          - dbphp
      # phpmyadmin
      phpmyadmin:
        depends_on:
          - db
        image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
        restart: always
        ports:
          - '8080:80'
        environment:
          PMA_HOST: db
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password 
        networks:
          - dbphp
    networks:
      dbphp:
    volumes:
      db_data:
    ```
3. Run Docker Compose:
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4. In order to stop Docker Compose:
    ```
    docker-compose down --volumes
    ```
